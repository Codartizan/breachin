def johnson(G, weight='weight'):
    r"""Uses Johnson's Algorithm to compute shortest paths.

    Johnson's Algorithm finds a shortest path between each pair of
    nodes in a weighted graph even if negative weights are present.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.

       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : dictionary
       Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of shortest paths.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       If given graph is not weighted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> graph = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> graph.add_weighted_edges_from([('0', '3', 3), ('0', '1', -5),
    ... ('0', '2', 2), ('1', '2', 4), ('2', '3', 1)])
    >>> paths = nx.johnson(graph, weight='weight')
    >>> paths['0']['2']
    ['0', '1', '2']

    Notes
    -----
    Johnson's algorithm is suitable even for graphs with negative weights. It
    works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of
    the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's
    algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.

    The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2 \log n + n m)$,
    where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the
    graph. For dense graphs, this may be faster than the Floyd–Warshall
    algorithm.

            A directed graph with the same name, same nodes, and with
            each edge (u, v, data) replaced by two directed edges
            (u, v, data) and (v, u, data).

        Notes
        -----
        This returns a "deepcopy" of the edge, node, and
        graph attributes which attempts to completely copy
        all of the data and references.

        This is in contrast to the similar D=DiGraph(G) which returns a
        shallow copy of the data.

        See the Python copy module for more information on shallow
        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html.

        Warning: If you have subclassed MultiGraph to use dict-like objects
        in the data structure, those changes do not transfer to the
        MultiDiGraph created by this method.

        """Returns a copy of the graph.

        The copy method by default returns an independent shallow copy
        of the graph and attributes. That is, if an attribute is a
        container, that container is shared by the original an the copy.
        Use Python's `copy.deepcopy` for new containers.

        If `as_view` is True then a view is returned instead of a copy.

        Notes
        -----
        All copies reproduce the graph structure, but data attributes
        may be handled in different ways. There are four types of copies
        of a graph that people might want.

        Deepcopy -- A "deepcopy" copies the graph structure as well as
        all data attributes and any objects they might contain.
        The entire graph object is new so that changes in the copy
        do not affect the original object. (see Python's copy.deepcopy)

        Data Reference (Shallow) -- For a shallow copy the graph structure
        is copied but the edge, node and graph attribute dicts are
        references to those in the original graph. This saves
        time and memory but could cause confusion if you change an attribute
        in one graph and it changes the attribute in the other.
        NetworkX does not provide this level of shallow copy.

        Independent Shallow -- This copy creates new independent attribute
        dicts and then does a shallow copy of the attributes. That is, any
        attributes that are containers are shared between the new graph
        and the original. This is exactly what `dict.copy()` provides.
        You can obtain this style copy using:

            >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
            >>> H = G.copy()
            >>> H = G.copy(as_view=False)
            >>> H = nx.Graph(G)
            >>> H = G.__class__(G)

        Fresh Data -- For fresh data, the graph structure is copied while
        new empty data attribute dicts are created. The resulting graph
        is independent of the original and it has no edge, node or graph
        attributes. Fresh copies are not enabled. Instead use:

            >>> H = G.__class__()
            >>> H.add_nodes_from(G)
            >>> H.add_edges_from(G.edges)

        View -- Inspired by dict-views, graph-views act like read-only
        versions of the original graph, providing a copy of the original
        structure without requiring any memory for copying the information.

        See the Python copy module for more information on shallow
        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html.

        Parameters
        ----------
        as_view : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, the returned graph-view provides a read-only view
            of the original graph without actually copying any data.

        -------
        G : Graph
            A copy of the graph.
